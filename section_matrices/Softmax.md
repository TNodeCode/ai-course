# The Softmax function

The softmax function is a mathematical function that is commonly used in machine learning, especially in multi-class classification tasks. It takes a vector of real-valued numbers as input and transforms them into a probability distribution over multiple classes.

The softmax function operates on a vector of logits (also known as log-odds or unnormalized scores). A logit is an unnormalized value that represents the model's confidence or evidence for each class. The softmax function normalizes these logits and maps them to a valid probability distribution.

Mathematically, the softmax function is defined as follows:

softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / Σ(exp(x_j))

Where:

x_i is the logit for the i-th class.
exp(x_i) represents the exponential of the logit, which ensures a non-negative value.
Σ denotes the summation symbol, and the sum is taken over all classes.
The softmax function exponentiates each logit and divides it by the sum of exponentiated logits across all classes. This normalization ensures that the resulting values lie between 0 and 1 and sum up to 1, representing valid probabilities.

The softmax function has a few important properties:

Output Interpretation: The output of the softmax function can be interpreted as the estimated probability of each class. Each value represents the model's confidence or belief that the input belongs to the corresponding class.

Class Competition: The softmax function introduces competition among classes. As the confidence of one class increases, the probabilities assigned to other classes decrease. The softmax function emphasizes the most probable class while suppressing the probabilities of less likely classes.

Sensitivity to Magnitude: The softmax function is sensitive to the magnitude or scale of the logits. Large differences between logits can lead to more pronounced differences in the resulting probabilities.

The softmax function is commonly used as the final activation function in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification tasks. It provides a differentiable and probabilistic representation of the model's predictions, enabling efficient training using techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent.

By applying the softmax function to the logits, the model's outputs can be interpreted as class probabilities, facilitating decision-making and allowing for selecting the most likely class prediction based on the highest probability value.
